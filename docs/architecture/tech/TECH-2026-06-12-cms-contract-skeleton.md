**Goal:** Build a SDKWork-compliant CMS backend contract skeleton with database, API, SDK, and Rust module boundaries ready for implementation by follow-up agents.

**Architecture:** CMS owns content modeling, entries, pages, publishing snapshots, feeds, audit, and outbox contracts. IAM, Drive, Search, Messaging, Comments, and Engagement remain dependency-owned and are consumed through SDK/service contracts rather than copied tables or APIs.

**Tech Stack:** Rust crate skeletons, SQL migration contracts, OpenAPI 3.1.2 contracts, SDKWork SDK family metadata, SDKWork repository/application standards.
